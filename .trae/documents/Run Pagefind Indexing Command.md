I'll run the Pagefind indexing command to update the search index for the HTML files in the post directory. Here's the plan:

1. Run the command `npx pagefind --site post --base-url "/post"` from the project root directory
2. Verify that the command completes successfully
3. Check that the pagefind directory has been updated with the latest index files

This will ensure that all HTML files in the post directory are properly indexed for the Pagefind search functionality that's already implemented in the HTML files.
